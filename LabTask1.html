        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>This is a basic HTML website to familiarize ourselves with it's structure. 
            This is a basic paragraph.
        </p> <!-- The <p> tag creates paragraphs -->
        <p>Now we will use some tags: <br><br>
            1.<strong>strong:</strong> This is used for <strong>important text.</strong>
            As we can see, it increased text opacity.<br>
            2.<em>em:</em> This is used for <em>emphasized text.</em>
            It can be seen that it tilts the text.<br>
            3.<mark>mark:</mark> This is used for <mark>marked text.</mark>
            It appears as a highlight.<br>
            4.<small>small:</small> This is used to make <small>small text.</small>
            The text under this tag has reduced font size.<br>
            5.br: It is used to go to next line. We've already used this several times. <br>
            6.hr: Used to split the page, just as shown below. <hr>
        </p> <!-- Example demonstration of several types of built in text formatting tags -->
